# PyGate
PyGate allows use of Python libraries from Smalltalk.
The author uses this to support MachineArithmetic temporarily until
everything necessary is available in Smalltalk.

## Installation
- To experiment with MachineArithmetic/Petrich2, install angr (preferably into python3).
- Install NeoJSON.
- Load `master` or `python3` branch depending on how you installed angr.
- execute `py/gate.py`.
